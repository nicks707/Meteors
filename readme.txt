hello there everyone ...

to play the game just extract all the contents to a directory and just double click on index.html 
i am enclosing my .class file so it will run as an applet ... if you wish to see the source 
just open absolute.java

it is my first attempt of game programming in java ( i do it in c#)

so please be polite .... :D 

the images are not made by me they are just gogled one :)

and i made it in a older version of java so please be cautious while compiling :P
